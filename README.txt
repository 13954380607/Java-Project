• Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner)
We communicate with each other
LinkedList.java(Dongnan Liu) 
ArrayList.java(David Qi)


• How to compile and run your program 
We use Intellij to compile and run our program. 
Everytime we click the green run button on the right top corner to compile and run our program. 


• Any assumptions
LinkedList and ArrayList implement the list interface so they include all of the method in the list.java.


• Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
 
• Any known bugs or defects in the program 
In Linkedlist I have num variable at first but I didn't use num in the size method.

• Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in the format: 
– the logic of interface method: TA
- Geogle
